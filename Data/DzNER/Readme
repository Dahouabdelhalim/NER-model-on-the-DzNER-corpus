# DzNER: A Large Algerian Named Entity Recognition Dataset

## Overview
DzNER is a dataset specifically crafted for Named Entity Recognition (NER) in the Algerian dialect, addressing the scarcity of resources for Arabic dialects in NLP research. This dataset features over 21,000 manually annotated sentences, amounting to more than 220,000 tokens from Algerian Facebook pages and YouTube channels, focusing on three entity types: Person, Location, and Organization.

## Dataset Composition
DzNER is enriched with sentences that incorporate both Latin and Arabic scripts, meticulously annotated to facilitate high-quality NER tasks.

### Data Collection
Data was sourced from popular social media platforms among the Algerian populace, ensuring a varied representation across multiple domains.

### Preprocessing and Annotation
Our dataset underwent rigorous preprocessing and manual annotation by domain experts, employing the IOB2 scheme for tagging to ensure accuracy and consistency.

### DzNER Statistics
DzNER's comprehensive statistics underscore its extensive coverage and diversity:

| Description              | Number    |
|--------------------------|-----------|
| Total Sentences          | 21,836    |
| Total Tokens             | 220,000+  |
| Annotated Entities       | 18,387    |
| - Person Entities        | 6,159     |
| - Location Entities      | 5,164     |
| - Organization Entities  | 2,312     |

## Model Performance
We assessed the dataset's utility by employing several advanced pre-trained language models, which demonstrated robust capabilities in recognizing named entities effectively across different categories.

### Experimental Setup
Our experimental framework utilized models optimized for Arabic dialects such as AraBERT and DziriBERT, comparing their efficacy on DzNER against other datasets.

### Results
The following table highlights the F1 scores achieved by these models across various entity types:

| Model       | Person  | Location | Organization |
|-------------|---------|----------|--------------|
| AraBERT     | 79.61%  | 76.01%   | 57.78%       |
| DziriBERT   | 79.74%  | 74.93%   | 54.31%       |
